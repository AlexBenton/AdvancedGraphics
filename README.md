** WARNINGS **

You can use this code freely for inspiration, examples of how to do it, examples of how not to do it... take your pick.  If you re-use large chunks of the code verbatim, please credit me.  Some portions of the math library come from Graphics Gems and other online sources.

This code comes with no warranty, express or implied.  It could break your PC, leak spoilers of your favorite shows, or insult your cat.  There should be unit tests, but there aren't.  There should be more cleanup and deallocation code for the OpenGL shader stuff, but there isn't.  Caveat emptor.

The code in this repo uses a Maven project ("pom.xml") to pull down the OS-specific binaries for JOGL, the Java OpenGL bindings.  (It pulls down the jars for Guava, too.)  To use
